#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#' Run a function under normal tzar or tzar emulation
#'
#' If you're building a package rather than writing freestanding
#' R code, R will execute all ".R" files in the package's R directory
#' every time the package is built.  This is a problem when using tzar
#' because tzar expects to find and run a file called model.R in the
#' directory with all the other R code for the project.  If the code
#' that builds the package finds that file, it will try to run the code in
#' model.R and there will be code not encapsulated in a function and
#' the builder will blow up when it runs that code.  For example,
#' you might need one or more library() calls in model.R and these
#' are not supposed to be executed inside package code.
#'
#' The way that run_tzar() is going to fake around this is to allow
#' you to to create a model.R by copying the code from some other
#' file into a file called model.R at the time tzar is run and then
#' remove it after tzar finishes.  This behavior is primarily
#' controlled by the boolean argument "copy_model_dot_R_tzar_file".
#' If that flag is TRUE, then run_tzar() will look at other
#' arguments to the function to determine source and destination
#' locations and file names and take care of the copying and cleaning
#' up after the run.
#'
#' If you are working on your project outside of building a package,
#' then it's not a problem to have the model.R code in the same
#' directory as your other R code that tzar expects to run for the
#' project.  In that case, just set the "copy_model_dot_R_tzar_file" to
#' FALSE and all the other arguments related to it will be ignored.
#'
#' NOTE:  Leaving the copying flag turned on does NOT hurt runs
#'        done outside of building a package, so it's recommended
#'        to just leave it turned on and put the code you would
#'        normally put in model.R in model.R.tzar instead and then
#'        let the run_tzar() manage all of that.  This way, you
#'        can use the emulator with the least amount of installation
#'        and management work for you when using the tzar package.
